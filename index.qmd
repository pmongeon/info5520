## Important note

Winter 2025 will be the first iteration of this new version of the course, which means that:

-   Most content is not yet available and will be uploaded over the course of the semester.
-   Depending on time constraints, some chapters may end up being very briefs, or include only a set of slides used for in-class presentations.

Thank you for your understanding!
