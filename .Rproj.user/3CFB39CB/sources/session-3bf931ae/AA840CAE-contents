## Course

## Course objectives

::: notes
I want you to learn something practical and useful. I want you to be better IMs, no matter what your specific field or career is or will be. I want you to be able to look at a report, a cover letter, a proposal, or an article and be able to ask it intelligent questions so that you know what it is, what it wants to do, and whether it does what it says it does.

I want you to understand that there are many ways to know and understand the world.

We will learn by doing. So that you can say you did it. And let’s focus on curiousity and learning through play and fun. This is the place where you can “fail”.
