# Overview {.unnumbered}

This book is a work-in-progress intended to support core courses in the Master of Information and Master of Information Management programs offered at the Faculty of Management at Dalhousie University. These courses provide an introduction to the information field and to the role that information plays in society and in the personal, professional and social lives of people.

## Acknowledgements

This book would not have been possible without the financial support, through an OER grant, of the [Dalhousie Center for Learning and Teaching](https://www.dal.ca/dept/clt.html) and the [Dalhousie Libraries](https://libraries.dal.ca/). It also would not have been possible without the help and support of Samantha Taylor, senior instructor and co-lead on the project, who orchestrated the writing of the case studies included throughout the book. It also would not have been possible without the hard work of Janine McGregor, Maddie Hare, Poppy Riddle, and Tessa Biesterfeld, students and alumni from the Dalhousie's Master of Information program, who helped draft some of the chapters or case studies. Special thanks to Janine McGregor, who played a leading role in the planning and writing of the book.
