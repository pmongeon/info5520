## Plan

-   Overview of the conceptual phase
-   Choosing a research topic
-   Enunciating the preliminary research question
-   Reviewing the literature

## The conceptual phase

-   Choosing a research problem and enunciating the preliminary research goal/question (this week).

-   Reviewing the literature (this week).

-   Defining the research framework (next week).

-   Formulating the final research problem (next week).

-   Formulating the specific research questions or hypotheses (next week).

# Defining a research problem and a preliminary research objective/question

## Sources of inspiration for research problems

-   Your own observations
-   Past research
-   Social issues
-   Theory
-   Practical problem
-   Organizational priorities

## Refining the problem

Three ways of refining the problem:

-   Approaching the topic from a specific (often disciplinary) perspective.
-   Setting a target population.
-   Identifying key concepts.

## Approaching the problem from a specific perspective

Example: Alcohol consumption by high school students

-   How does alcohol consumption affect academic performance (educational perspective).
-   How do teens with high alcohol consumption perceive themselves (psychological perspective).
-   How does social group affect the likelihood of high alcohol consumption among teens (sociological perspective).
-   How would you approach this problem from a library/informational perspective?

## Setting a target population

The population is not necessarily the particular group you will study, it's the group about which you want to produce knowledge. Example:

-   Young adults (very broad)
-   University students (broad)
-   Undergraduate students (less broad)
-   Dalhousie undergraduate students (narrow)
-   Undergraduate students in the faculty of Management (narrower)
-   Undergraduate students in a specific course (very narrow)

## Identifying key concepts

What are the specific concepts that you will be considering in your research? Example:

-   Information behaviour?
-   Information literacy?
-   Access?
-   Misinformation?
-   Information overload?

## Formulating a preliminary research objective/question

-   This is a high-level, **preliminary** research question that reflects the main purpose of your research.

-   Another way to think about this is to separate the research topic, research problem, research goal, and research questions/hypotheses. At this stage, we are defining the research goal (formulated as a question), which will eventually be divided into several specific research questions.

-   The research question is finalized after the literature review stage.

## Examples {.smaller}

"we examine how factors related to the tweeter (e.g., academic age, research activity, tweeting activity) and the relationship between the tweeter and the tweeted works (e.g., shared field, authors, or geographical location) may affect the probability that a researcher tweeting a paper will also cite that same paper." [@hare2024]

"This paper \[...\] investigat\[es\] the coverage of gold and diamond journals in WoS and Scopus. Additionally, we seek to determine whether there is empirical support for the narrative that diamond journals are more community-driven and local in nature by analyzing the geographical and linguistic characteristics of gold and diamond journals and their relation to WoS and Scopus coverage. Further, it examines the characteristics of indexed diamond journals, such as country of publication, geographic concentration of authors, to produce a fuller portrait and subsequent understanding of how and why publications are represented in bibliometric databases.

## Characteristics of a good research objective/question

-   **Relevant**: the research goal is of interest to the target audience.

-   **Significant**: fulfilling the research goal would significantly advance knowledge.

-   **Feasible**: the research goal is possible and likely to be achieved.

-   **Related to theory**: the research goal implicitly or explicitly draws from and/or contributes to theory.

# Literature review

## Purpose

-   Establish the state of knowledge (to help identify the gaps).

-   Define and delineate the research problem.

-   Identify the key concepts.

-   Gain methodological insights.

-   Learn from the results, limitations, and recommendations of past studies.

-   Position your research within the existing literature.

-   Gives credibility to your work.

## Example: map of the LIS literature

## Information sources

-   **Empirical sources**: publications that report results of empirical studies.

-   **Theoretical sources**: publications that present concepts, models, theories, or conceptual frameworks.

-   **Primary sources**: report of study by the researcher(s) who conducted it.

-   **Secondary sources**: synthesis, summary, or commentary on a work by someone other than the author of the original work (e.g., textbook, encyclopedia, reviews, annotated bibliography)

## Process overview

-   Define search strategy
-   Select sources
-   Implement search strategy (perform the search)
-   Identify relevant literature
-   Critically appraise the selected literature
-   Synthesize the selected literature

## Defining search strategy

-   Identify the core concepts that constitute your research problem.
-   For each concept, identify synonyms and other terms that could retrieve literature associated with each related term.
-   Most of you are likely familiar with the literature search process, but if not, you can check out the [Zombool game](https://libraries.dal.ca/help/academic/zombool.html).

## Selecting sources

Where are you going to search for information, for example:

-   Library catalogue
-   Specialized or multidisciplinary database
-   Internet

## Implementing the search strategy

Basically, the search is run in the selected database(s).

## Determine relevancy

At this stage, the goal is to determine what the retrieved publications are about and filter out the ones that are not relevant to your study.

-   Key data points: the title, the abstract, and the research objectives.

-   Consider creating a screening spreadsheet with three columns:

    -   Title
    -   Year
    -   Source (e.g. journal)
    -   Abstract
    -   Research objectives

## Critically appraise the selected literature

Once you identified relevant sources, your next step is assessing their quality. Here are some criteria to consider:

-   Is the research problem and objective clear?
-   Is it relevant and significant for the field?
-   Is the literature review present and adequate?
-   Are the concepts defined? Is the theoretical framework explicit and justified?
-   Are the research questions clearly enunciated?
-   Is the population described?
-   Are the methods clearly described?
-   Is the method suited to the research objectives?
-   Is the research ethically conducted?
-   Are the results clearly presented?
-   Are the visualizations (tables, graphs) helpful?
-   Are the results adequately interpreted and related to the past literature?
-   Are the limitations of the study described?
-   Are the conclusions supported by the data and results?

## Synthesize the selected literature

At this stage, you could, in principle, start writing your literature review.

-   Extract and synthesize useful information from the literature.
-   Best to have a plan or to build one along the way!
    -   You can also synthesize articles individually and integrate them later.

## Repeat until saturation

Use what you've learned in the first round of the literature review to:

-   Refine your search strategy.
-   Try to fill gaps in the literature review.
-   Find additional relevant sources using other methods, such as:
    -   Citation tracking from core sources.
    -   Look up the Google Scholar profile of core authors identified in your reviews.

## Examples of literature review

Structured literature reviews (with headings delineating the different aspects covered).

-   [Do you cite what you tweet?](https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/5/2/332/119741/Do-you-cite-what-you-tweet-Investigating-the)
-   [Mapping information research in Canada](https://www.erudit.org/en/journals/cjils/2023-v46-n2-cjils08989/1108307ar.pdf)

Articles that don't have a distinct literature review section (the literature review is implicit and embedded in the introduction.

-   [The rise of the middle author](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0184601)
